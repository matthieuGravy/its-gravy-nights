## It's Gravy Nights

The project

My client is extremely pleased with the Bootstrap website I previously created for him. At that time, his budget did not allow for a larger website. However, with the growing success of his franchises, he now plans to diversify his business model by entering the events industry. He wishes to incorporate several key features:

- [ ] Newsletter Database
- [x] Contact Information Collection Database
- [ ] Back Office Login System
- [ ] Direct Purchase Capability for Customers
